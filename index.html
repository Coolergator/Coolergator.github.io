    <br>
    Wow! You're actually on the website.<br>
    Someone had to have told you about it.<br>
    There are a couple of things in store for the site.<br>
    They just might take time to get to, alright.<br>
    I want nothing more than for you to enjoy yourself with the site.<br>
    Just don't take things too seriously please.   
    </p>
    Alright, now that's done with. I guess I'll just serve as your guide through the site.
    <p>
    . . . What are you talking about? I'm still here.<br>
    I'd like to help too. 
    </p>
    Huh? What, no.
    <p>
    Why? I have nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <em>oh my-</em> Fine. Just keep quiet. You take up a lot stuff of space when you talk.
    <p>
    That's not fair at all. How will I do able to help?
    </p>
    Wh- What did I just say? Quiet, uhh... huh.<br>
    I just realized that neither of us have names. Strange.<br>
    <br>
    You would probably be called like... Bluecard or something. Heh. Yeah, that's your name.
    <p>
    Suuure, Plaintext. Whatever you say.
    </p>
    Plaintext!
    <p>
